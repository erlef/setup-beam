    "body": "## OTP 27.0-rc3\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 27.0-rc3 is the third and final release candidate before the OTP 27.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue at [https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues) or by posting to [Erlang Forums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-27.0-rc3) release and you can view the new documentation at [https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc3/doc](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc3/doc/). \r\n\r\nYou can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkerl build 27.0-rc3 27.0-rc3.\r\n```\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 27 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\n# Notable changes in RC3\r\n\r\n* The support for multiple trace sessions is [now documented](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/trace) and ready for use.\r\n\r\n# Highlights for RC2\r\n\r\n* There is a new module [json](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json) for encoding and decoding [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).\r\n\r\n  Both encoding and decoding can be customized. Decoding can be done in a SAX-like fashion and handle multiple documents and streams of data.\r\n\r\n  The new `json` module is used by the `jer` (JSON Encoding Rules) for ASN.1 for encoding and decoding JSON. Thus, there is no longer any need to supply an external JSON library.\r\n\r\n# Other notable changes in RC2\r\n\r\n* The existing experimental support for archive files will be changed in a future release. The support for having an archive in an escript will remain, but the support for using archives in a release will either become more limited or completely removed.\r\n\r\n  As of Erlang/OTP 27, the function `code:lib_dir/2`, the `-code_path_choice` flag, and using `erl_prim_loader` for reading members of an archive are deprecated.\r\n\r\n  To remain compatible with future version of Erlang/OTP `escript` scripts that need to retrieve data files from its archive should use `escript:extract/2` instead of `erl_prim_loader` and `code:lib_dir/2`.\r\n\r\n* The order in which the compiler looks up options has changed.\r\n\r\n  When there is a conflict in the compiler options given in the `-compile()` attribute and options given to the compiler, the options given in the `-compile()` attribute overrides the option given to the compiler, which in turn overrides options given in the `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS` environment variable.\r\n\r\n  Example:\r\n\r\n  If `some_module.erl` has the following attribute:\r\n\r\n  ```erlang\r\n  -compile([nowarn_missing_spec]).\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and the compiler is invoked like so:\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  % erlc +warn_missing_spec some_module.erl\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  no warnings will be issued for functions that do not have any specs.\r\n\r\n\r\n* `configure` now automatically enables support for year-2038-safe timestamps.\r\n\r\n  By default `configure` scripts used when building OTP will now try to enable support for timestamps that will work after mid-January\r\n  2038. This has typically only been an issue on 32-bit platforms.  If `configure` cannot figure out how to enable such timestamps, it will abort with an error message. If you want to build the system anyway, knowing that the system will not function properly after mid-January 2038, you can pass the `--disable-year2038` option to `configure`, which will enable `configure` to continue without support for timestamps after mid-January 2038.'\r\n\r\n# Highlights for RC1\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[EEP-59](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059) has been implemented. Documentation attributes in source files can now be used to document functions, types, callbacks, and modules.\r\n\r\nThe entire Erlang/OTP documentation is now using the new documentation system.\r\n\r\n## New language features\r\n\r\n* Triple-Quoted Strings has been implemented as per [EEP 64](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064) to allow a string to encompass a complete paragraph.\r\n\r\n* Adjacent string literals without intervening white space is now a syntax error, to avoid possible confusion with triple-quoted strings.\r\n\r\n* Sigils on string literals (both ordinary and triple-quoted) have been implemented as per [EEP  66](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0066). For example, `~\"Björn\"` or `~b\"Björn\"` are now equivalent to `<<\"Björn\"/utf8>>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT improvements\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now merge consecutive updates of the same record.\r\n\r\n* Safe destructive update of tuples has been implemented in the compiler and runtime system. This allows the VM to update tuples in-place when it is safe to do so, thus improving performance by doing less copying but also by producing less garbage.\r\n\r\n* The `maybe` expression is now enabled by default, eliminating the need for enabling the `maybe_expr` feature.\r\n\r\n* Native coverage support has been implemented in the JIT. It will automatically be used by the `cover` tool to reduce the execution overhead when running cover-compiled code. There are also new APIs to support native coverage without using the `cover` tool.\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now raise a warning when updating record/map literals to catch a common mistake. For example, the compiler will now emit a warning for `#r{a=1}#r{b=2}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ERTS\r\n\r\n* The `erl` command now supports the `-S` flag, which is similar to the `-run` flag, but with some of the rough edges filed off.\r\n\r\n* By default, escripts will now be compiled instead of interpreted. That means that the `compiler` application must be installed.\r\n\r\n* The default process limit has been raised to `1048576` processes.\r\n\r\n* The `erlang:system_monitor/2` functionality is now able to monitor long message queues in the system.\r\n\r\n* The obsolete and undocumented support for opening a port to an external resource by passing an atom (or a string) as first argument to `open_port()`, implemented by the vanilla driver, has been removed. This feature has been scheduled for removal in OTP 27 since the release of OTP 26.\r\n\r\n* The `pid` field has been removed from `erlang:fun_info/1,2`.\r\n\r\n* Multiple trace sessions are now supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## STDLIB\r\n\r\n* Several new functions that accept funs have been added to module `timer`.\r\n\r\n* The functions `is_equal/2`, `map/2`, and `filtermap/2` have been added to the modules `sets`, `ordsets`, and `gb_sets`.\r\n\r\n* There are new efficient `ets` traversal functions with guaranteed atomicity. For example, `ets:next/2` followed by `ets:lookup/2` can now be replaced with `ets:next_lookup/1`.\r\n\r\n* The new function `ets:update_element/4` is similar to `ets:update_element/3`, but takes a default tuple as the fourth argument, which will be inserted if no previous record with that key exists.\r\n\r\n* `binary:replace/3,4` now supports using a fun for supplying the replacement binary.\r\n\r\n* The new function `proc_lib:set_label/1` can be used to add a descriptive term to any process that does not have a registered name. The name will\r\n  be shown by tools such as `c:i/0` and `observer`, and it will be included in crash reports produced by processes using `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, `gen_event`, and `gen_fsm`.\r\n\r\n* Added functions to retrieve the next higher or lower key/element from `gb_trees` and `gb_sets`, as well as returning iterators that start at given keys/elements.\r\n\r\n## common_test\r\n\r\n* Calls to `ct:capture_start/0` and `ct:capture_stop/0` are now synchronous to ensure that all output is captured.\r\n\r\n* The default CSS will now include a basic dark mode handling if it is preferred by the browser.\r\n\r\n## crypto\r\n\r\n* The functions `crypto_dyn_iv_init/3` and `crypto_dyn_iv_update/3` that were marked as deprecated in Erlang/OTP 25 have been removed.\r\n\r\n## dialyzer\r\n\r\n* The `--gui` option for Dialyzer has been removed.\r\n\r\n## ssl\r\n\r\n* The `ssl` client can negotiate and handle certificate status request (OCSP stapling support on the client side).\r\n\r\n## tools\r\n\r\n* There is a new tool `tprof`, which combines the functionality of `eprof` and `cprof` under one interface. It also adds heap profiling.\r\n\r\n## xmerl\r\n\r\n* As an alternative to `xmerl_xml`, a new export module `xmerl_xml_indent` that provides out-of-the box indented output has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [README](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_27.0-rc2.readme).",

improved so that Erlang and OS monotonic time are\r\n               checked separately.\r\n\r\n               A new configure argument\r\n               --enable-ensure-os-monotonic-time has also been added.\r\n               It enables functionality ensuring the monotonicity of\r\n               monotonic timestamps delivered by the OS. When a\r\n               non-monotonic timestamp is detected, it will be\r\n               replaced by the last delivered monotonic timestamp\r\n               before being used by Erlang's time functionality. Note\r\n               that you do not want to enable this unless the OS\r\n               monotonic time source on the system fails to produce\r\n               monotonic timestamps.

When a\n               non-monotonic timestamp is detected, it will be\n               replaced by the last delivered monotonic timestamp\n               before being used by Erlang's time functionality. Note\n               that you do not want to enable this unless the OS\n               monotonic time source on the system fails to produce\n               monotonic timestamps.

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 27.0-rc2 is the second release candidate of three before the OTP 27.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users.\r\nAll feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue at\r\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues) or by posting to [Erlang Forums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-27.0-rc2) release\r\n and you can view the new documentation at [https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc2/doc](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc2/doc/).\r\nYou can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkerl build 27.0-rc2 27.0-rc2.\r\n```\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 27 is a new major release with new features, improvements\r\nas well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are\r\nhighlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\n# Highlights for RC2\r\n\r\n* There is a new module [json](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json) for encoding and decoding [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).\r\n\r\n  Both encoding and decoding can be customized. Decoding can be done in a\r\n  SAX-like fashion and handle multiple documents and streams of data.\r\n\r\n  The new `json` module is used by the `jer` (JSON Encoding Rules) for ASN.1\r\n  for encoding and decoding JSON. Thus, there is no longer any need to supply\r\n  an external JSON library.\r\n\r\n# Other notable changes in RC2\r\n\r\n* The existing experimental support for archive files will be changed in a\r\n  future release. The support for having an archive in an escript will remain,\r\n  but the support for using archives in a release will either become more\r\n  limited or completely removed.\r\n\r\n  As of Erlang/OTP 27, the function `code:lib_dir/2`, the `-code_path_choice`\r\n  flag, and using `erl_prim_loader` for reading members of an archive are\r\n  deprecated.\r\n\r\n  To remain compatible with future version of Erlang/OTP `escript` scripts that\r\n  need to retrieve data files from its archive should use `escript:extract/2`\r\n  instead of `erl_prim_loader` and `code:lib_dir/2`.\r\n\r\n* The order in which the compiler looks up options has changed.\r\n\r\n  When there is a conflict in the compiler options given in the `-compile()`\r\n  attribute and options given to the compiler, the options given in the\r\n  `-compile()` attribute overrides the option given to the compiler, which in\r\n  turn overrides options given in the `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS` environment\r\n  variable.\r\n\r\n  Example:\r\n\r\n  If `some_module.erl` has the following attribute:\r\n\r\n  ```erlang\r\n  -compile([nowarn_missing_spec]).\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and the compiler is invoked like so:\r\n\r\n  ```text\r\n  % erlc +warn_missing_spec some_module.erl\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  no warnings will be issued for functions that do not have any specs.\r\n\r\n* `configure` now automatically enables support for year-2038-safe timestamps.\r\n\r\n  By default `configure` scripts used when building OTP will now try\r\n  to enable support for timestamps that will work after mid-January\r\n  2038. This has typically only been an issue on 32-bit platforms.\r\n\r\n  If `configure` cannot figure out how to enable such timestamps, it\r\n  will abort with an error message. If you want to build the system\r\n  anyway, knowing that the system will not function properly after\r\n  mid-January 2038, you can pass the `--disable-year2038` option to\r\n  `configure`, which will enable `configure` to continue without\r\n  support for timestamps after mid-January 2038.\r\n\r\n# Highlights for RC1\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[EEP-59](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059) has been\r\nimplemented. Documentation attributes in source files can now be used\r\nto document functions, types, callbacks, and modules.\r\n\r\nThe entire Erlang/OTP documentation is now using the new documentation\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n## New language features\r\n\r\n* Triple-Quoted Strings has been implemented as per\r\n  [EEP 64](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064) to allow a string\r\n  to encompass a complete paragraph.\r\n\r\n* Adjacent string literals without intervening white space is now a syntax\r\n  error, to avoid possible confusion with triple-quoted strings.\r\n\r\n* Sigils on string literals (both ordinary and triple-quoted) have\r\n  been implemented as per\r\n  [EEP  66](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0066). For example,\r\n  `~\"Björn\"` or `~b\"Björn\"` are now equivalent to `<<\"Björn\"/utf8>>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT improvements\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now merge consecutive updates of the same record.\r\n\r\n* Safe destructive update of tuples has been implemented in the compiler\r\n  and runtime system. This allows the VM to update tuples in-place when it\r\n  is safe to do so, thus improving performance by doing less copying but\r\n  also by producing less garbage.\r\n\r\n* The `maybe` expression is now enabled by default, eliminating the need\r\n  for enabling the `maybe_expr` feature.\r\n\r\n* Native coverage support has been implemented in the JIT. It will\r\n  automatically be used by the `cover` tool to reduce the execution\r\n  overhead when running cover-compiled code. There are also new APIs\r\n  to support native coverage without using the `cover` tool.\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now raise a warning when updating record/map literals\r\n  to catch a common mistake. For example, the compiler will now emit a\r\n  warning for `#r{a=1}#r{b=2}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ERTS\r\n\r\n* The `erl` command now supports the `-S` flag, which is similar to\r\n  the `-run` flag, but with some of the rough edges filed off.\r\n\r\n* By default, escripts will now be compiled instead of interpreted. That\r\n  means that the `compiler` application must be installed.\r\n\r\n* The default process limit has been raised to `1048576` processes.\r\n\r\n* The `erlang:system_monitor/2` functionality is now able to monitor long\r\n  message queues in the system.\r\n\r\n* The obsolete and undocumented support for opening a port to an external\r\n  resource by passing an atom (or a string) as first argument to\r\n  `open_port()`, implemented by the vanilla driver,\r\n  has been removed. This feature has been scheduled for removal in OTP 27\r\n  since the release of OTP 26.\r\n\r\n* The `pid` field has been removed from `erlang:fun_info/1,2`.\r\n\r\n* Multiple trace sessions are now supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## STDLIB\r\n\r\n* Several new functions that accept funs have been added to module `timer`.\r\n\r\n* The functions `is_equal/2`, `map/2`, and `filtermap/2` have been added to\r\n  the modules `sets`, `ordsets`, and `gb_sets`.\r\n\r\n* There are new efficient `ets` traversal functions with guaranteed atomicity.\r\n  For example, `ets:next/2` followed by `ets:lookup/2` can now be replaced\r\n  with `ets:next_lookup/1`.\r\n\r\n* The new function `ets:update_element/4` is similar to `ets:update_element/3`,\r\n  but takes a default tuple as the fourth argument, which will be inserted\r\n  if no previous record with that key exists.\r\n\r\n* `binary:replace/3,4` now supports using a fun for supplying the\r\n  replacement binary.\r\n\r\n* The new function `proc_lib:set_label/1` can be used to add a descriptive\r\n  term to any process that does not have a registered name. The name will\r\n  be shown by tools such as `c:i/0` and `observer`, and it will be included\r\n  in crash reports produced by processes using `gen_server`, `gen_statem`,\r\n  `gen_event`, and `gen_fsm`.\r\n\r\n* Added functions to retrieve the next higher or lower key/element from\r\n  `gb_trees` and `gb_sets`, as well as returning iterators that start at\r\n  given keys/elements.\r\n\r\n## common_test\r\n\r\n* Calls to `ct:capture_start/0` and `ct:capture_stop/0` are now synchronous to\r\n  ensure that all output is captured.\r\n\r\n* The default CSS will now include a basic dark mode handling if it is\r\n  preferred by the browser.\r\n\r\n## crypto\r\n\r\n* The functions `crypto_dyn_iv_init/3` and `crypto_dyn_iv_update/3`\r\n  that were marked as deprecated in Erlang/OTP 25 have been removed.\r\n\r\n## dialyzer\r\n\r\n* The `--gui` option for Dialyzer has been removed.\r\n\r\n## ssl\r\n\r\n* The `ssl` client can negotiate and handle certificate status request (OCSP\r\n  stapling support on the client side).\r\n\r\n## tools\r\n\r\n* There is a new tool `tprof`, which combines the functionality of `eprof`\r\n  and `cprof` under one interface. It also adds heap profiling.\r\n\r\n## xmerl\r\n\r\n* As an alternative to `xmerl_xml`, a new export module `xmerl_xml_indent`\r\n  that provides out-of-the box indented output has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [README](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_27.0-rc2.readme).",

    "body": "## OTP 27.0-rc1\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 27.0-rc1 is the first release candidate of three before the OTP 27.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users.\r\nAll feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue at\r\n[https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues](https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues) or by\r\nposting to [Erlang Forums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the\r\n[Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-27.0-rc1) release\r\nand you can view the new documentation at\r\n[https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc1/doc](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-15.0-rc1/doc/).\r\nYou can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkerl build 27.0-rc1 27.0-rc1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 27 is a new major release with new features, improvements\r\nas well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are\r\nhighlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[EEP-59](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059) has been\r\nimplemented. Documentation attributes in source files can now be used\r\nto document functions, types, callbacks, and modules.\r\n\r\nThe entire Erlang/OTP documentation is now using the new documentation\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n## New language features\r\n\r\n* Triple-Quoted Strings has been implemented as per\r\n  [EEP 64](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064) to allow a string\r\n  to encompass a complete paragraph.\r\n\r\n* Adjacent string literals without intervening white space is now a syntax\r\n  error, to avoid possible confusion with triple-quoted strings.\r\n\r\n* Sigils on string literals (both ordinary and triple-quoted) have\r\n  been implemented as per\r\n  [EEP  66](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0066). For example,\r\n  `~\"Björn\"` or `~b\"Björn\"` are now equivalent to `<<\"Björn\"/utf8>>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT improvements\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now merge consecutive updates of the same record.\r\n\r\n* Safe destructive update of tuples has been implemented in the compiler\r\n  and runtime system. This allows the VM to update tuples in-place when it\r\n  is safe to do so, thus improving performance by doing less copying but\r\n  also by producing less garbage.\r\n\r\n* The `maybe` expression is now enabled by default, eliminating the need\r\n  for enabling the `maybe_expr` feature.\r\n\r\n* Native coverage support has been implemented in the JIT. It will\r\n  automatically be used by the `cover` tool to reduce the execution\r\n  overhead when running cover-compiled code. There are also new APIs\r\n  to support native coverage without using the `cover` tool.\r\n\r\n* The compiler will now raise a warning when updating record/map literals\r\n  to catch a common mistake. For example, the compiler will now emit a\r\n  warning for `#r{a=1}#r{b=2}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ERTS\r\n\r\n* The `erl` command now supports the `-S` flag, which is similar to\r\n  the `-run` flag, but with some of the rough edges filed off.\r\n\r\n* By default, escripts will now be compiled instead of interpreted. That\r\n  means that the `compiler` application must be installed.\r\n\r\n* The default process limit has been raised to `1048576` processes.\r\n\r\n* The `erlang:system_monitor/2` functionality is now able to monitor long\r\n  message queues in the system.\r\n\r\n* The obsolete and undocumented support for opening a port to an external\r\n  resource by passing an atom (or a string) as first argument to\r\n  `open_port()`, implemented by the vanilla driver,\r\n  has been removed. This feature has been scheduled for removal in OTP 27\r\n  since the release of OTP 26.\r\n\r\n* The `pid` field has been removed from `erlang:fun_info/1,2`.\r\n\r\n* Multiple trace sessions are now supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## STDLIB\r\n\r\n* Several new functions that accept funs have been added to module `timer`.\r\n\r\n* The functions `is_equal/2`, `map/2`, and `filtermap/2` have been added to\r\n  the modules `sets`, `ordsets`, and `gb_sets`.\r\n\r\n* There are new efficient `ets` traversal functions with guaranteed atomicity.\r\n  For example, `ets:next/2` followed by `ets:lookup/2` can now be replaced\r\n  with `ets:next_lookup/1`.\r\n\r\n* The new function `ets:update_element/4` is similar to `ets:update_element/3`,\r\n  but takes a default tuple as the fourth argument, which will be inserted\r\n  if no previous record with that key exists.\r\n\r\n* `binary:replace/3,4` now supports using a fun for supplying the\r\n  replacement binary.\r\n\r\n* The new function `proc_lib:set_label/1` can be used to add a descriptive\r\n  term to any process that does not have a registered name. The name will\r\n  be shown by tools such as `c:i/0` and `observer`, and it will be included\r\n  in crash reports produced by processes using `gen_server`, `gen_statem`,\r\n  `gen_event`, and `gen_fsm`.\r\n\r\n* Added functions to retrieve the next higher or lower key/element from\r\n  `gb_trees` and `gb_sets`, as well as returning iterators that start at\r\n  given keys/elements.\r\n\r\n## common_test\r\n\r\n* Calls to `ct:capture_start/0` and `ct:capture_stop/0` are now synchronous to\r\n  ensure that all output is captured.\r\n\r\n* The default CSS will now include a basic dark mode handling if it is\r\n  preferred by the browser.\r\n\r\n## crypto\r\n\r\n* The functions `crypto_dyn_iv_init/3` and `crypto_dyn_iv_update/3`\r\n  that were marked as deprecated in Erlang/OTP 25 have been removed.\r\n\r\n## dialyzer\r\n\r\n* The `--gui` option for Dialyzer has been removed.\r\n\r\n## ssl\r\n\r\n* The `ssl` client can negotiate and handle certificate status request (OCSP\r\n  stapling support on the client side).\r\n\r\n## tools\r\n\r\n* There is a new tool `tprof`, which combines the functionality of `eprof`\r\n  and `cprof` under one interface. It also adds heap profiling.\r\n\r\n## xmerl\r\n\r\n* As an alternative to `xmerl_xml`, a new export module `xmerl_xml_indent`\r\n  that provides out-of-the box indented output has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [README](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_27.0-rc1.readme).\r\n",

The erts-13.2.2.3 application *cannot* be applied independently\n       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 25 installation.\n\n       On a full OTP 25 installation, also the following runtime\n       dependencies have to be satisfied:\n       -- kernel-8.5 (first satisfied in OTP 25.1)\n       -- stdlib-4.1 (first satisfied in OTP 25.1)\n\n\n --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---\n\n  OTP-18647    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-7595\n\n               A process optimized for parallel signal delivery could\n               under some circumstances lose wakeup information. That\n               is, the processes was not woken up to take care of the\n               signal, so the signal would not be taken care of until\n               the process was woken by another signal. Only processes\n               configured with message_queue_data set to off_heap\n               utilize this optimization.\n\n\n  OTP-18706    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): ERIERL-979, GH-7413, PR-7595\n\n               Delivery time of message signals to a process not\n               executing any receive expressions could become very\n               long, potentially infinite. For example, a process\n               checking for messages using process_info(self(),\n               message_queue_len) or process_info(self(), messages)\n               and avoiding to execute a receive expression matching\n               on messages could be very slow in detecting new\n               messages. Note that you are still discouraged from\n               using process_info() this way. A process that wants to\n               check if there are messages available to handle should\n               execute a receive expression matching on messages.\n\n\n  OTP-18732    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): GH-7444, PR-7458\n\n               Fix bug causing \"magic\" references in a compressed ETS\n               table to not keep the referred object alive. The\n               symptom would be the referred object being garbage\n               collected prematurely and the reference appearing\n               stale, not referring to anything.

The erts-13.2.2.1 application *cannot* be applied independently\n       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 25 installation.\n\n       On a full OTP 25 installation, also the following runtime\n       dependencies have to be satisfied:\n       -- kernel-8.5 (first satisfied in OTP 25.1)\n       -- stdlib-4.1 (first satisfied in OTP 25.1)\n\n\n --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---\n\n  OTP-18561    Application(s): erts\n\n               Fixed a crash during tracing on certain platforms that\n               cannot use the machine stack for Erlang code (mainly\n               OpenBSD and Linux with musl).\n\n\n  OTP-18597    Application(s): erts\n\n               Constructing a binary segment not aligned with a byte\n               boundary, with a size not fitting in 31 bits, and with\n               a value not fitting in a 64-bit word could crash the\n               runtime system.\n\n\n --- Improvements and New Features ---\n\n  OTP-18569    Application(s): erts\n\n               Further robustify implementation of large maps (> 32\n               keys). Keys that happen to have same internal 32-bit\n               hash values are now put in collision nodes which are\n               traversed with linear search.

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 26.0 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the highlights of the release:\r\n\r\nThere is also a [Blogpost](https://www.erlang.org/blog/otp-26-highlights/) about the highlights.\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\n## Parsetools\r\n\r\n- `Leex` has been extended with optional column number support.\r\n\r\n## Stdlib\r\n\r\n- The family of enumeration functions in module `lists` has been extended with `enumerate/3` that allows a step value to be supplied.\r\n- Update Unicode to version 15.0.0.\r\n- `proc_lib:start*/*` has become synchronous when the started process fails. This requires that a failing process use a new function `proc_lib:init_fail/2,3`, or exits, to indicate failure. All OTP behaviours have been fixed to do this.\r\n\r\n## The Shell\r\nThere are a lot of new features and improvements in the Erlang shell:\r\n- auto-complete of variables, record names, record fields names, map keys, function parameter types and filenames.\r\n- Open external editor in the shell to edit the current expression.\r\n- defining records (with types), functions, specs and types in the shell.\r\n\r\n## New terminal\r\n- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten. Windows users will notice that `erl.exe` has the same functionality as a normal Unix shell and that `werl.exe` is just a symlink to `erl.exe`.  This makes the Windows Erlang terminal  experience identical to that of Unix.\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of binaries with segments of fixed sizes have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of UTF-8 segments have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Appending to binaries has been optimized.\r\n\r\n- The compiler and JIT now generate better code for creation of small maps where all keys  are literals known at compile time.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to the optimizations above the performance of the `base64` module has been significantly improved. For example, on an x86_64 system with the JIT both encode and  decode are almost three times faster than in Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\n- Map comprehensions as suggested in [EEP 58](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0058) has now been implemented.\r\n\r\n- Some map operations have been optimized by changing the internal sort order of atom keys. \r\n  This changes the (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small maps are printed and returned by `maps:to_list/1` and `maps:next/1`. The new order is unpredictable and may change between different invocations of the Erlang VM.\r\n\r\n- Introducing the new function `maps:iterator/2` for creating an interator that return the map elements in a deterministic order.\r\n  There are also new modifiers `k` and `K` for the format string in `io:format()` to support printing map elements ordered.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Added the new built-in type `dynamic()` introduced in [EEP 61](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0061), [PR introducing EEP 61](https://github.com/erlang/eep/pull/44) improving support for gradual type checkers.\r\n\r\n- Dialyzer has a new incremental mode that be invoked by giving the `--incremental` option when running Dialyzer.\r\n  This new incremental mode is likely to become the default in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Misc ERTS, Stdlib, Kernel, Compiler\r\n- Multi [time warp mode](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-modes) is now enabled by default.\r\n  This assumes that all code executing on the system is  [time warp safe](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-safe-code).\r\n\r\n- Support for UTF-8 atoms and strings in the NIF\r\n  interface including new functions `enif_make_new_atom`,  `enif_make_new_atom_len` and `enif_get_string_length`.\r\n\r\n- The BIFs `min/2` and `max/2` are now allowed to be used in guards and match specs.\r\n\r\n- Improved the selective receive optimization, which can now be enabled for references returned from other\r\n  functions. This greatly improves the performance of  `gen_server:send_request/3`, `gen_server:wait_response/2`, and similar functions.\r\n\r\n- New trace feature `call_memory`. Similar to `call_time`  tracing, but instead of measure accumulated time in traced functions it measures accumulated heap space consumed by traced functions. It can be used to compare how much different functions are contributing to garbage collection being triggered.\r\n\r\n- It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the runtime system in order to load modules that are using it. \r\nIt is sufficient to enable the feature in the compiler when compiling it.\r\n\r\n- `inet:setopts/2` has got 3 new options: `reuseport`, `reuseport_lb` and `exclusiveaddruse`.\r\n\r\n- Fix so that `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` is applied to all of the Erlang VM when using the JIT so that tools, such as `perf`, can crawl the process stacks.\r\n\r\n- In the `lists` module, the zip family of functions now takes options to allow handling lists of different lengths.\r\n\r\n- Added the `zip:zip_get_crc32/2` function to retrieve the `CRC32` checksum from an opened ZIP archive.\r\n`gen_server` optimized by caching callback functions\r\n\r\n- The modules Erlang DNS resolver `inet_res` and helper modules have been updated for RFC6891; to handle OPT RR with DNSSEC OK (DO) bit.\r\n\r\n- Introduced `application:get_supervisor/1`.\r\n\r\n- Cache OTP boot code paths, to limit how many folders that are being accessed during a module lookup. Can be disabled with `-cache_boot_path false`. \r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Change the client default `verify` option to `verify_peer`.\r\n    *Note* that this makes it mandatory to also supply trusted CA certificates or explicitly set `verify` to `verify_none`. This also applies when using the so called anonymous test cipher suites defined in TLS versions pre TLS-1.3.\r\n\r\n- Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the SSL application, for TLS distribution (`-proto_dist` `inet_tls`), the SSL option `{ktls, true}`. \r\n- Improved error checking and handling of ssl options.\r\n- Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by lowering the maximum handshake size. This should not effect the common cases, if needed it can be configured to a higher value.\r\n\r\n- For security reasons the `SHA1` and `DSA` algorithms are no longer among the default values.\r\n\r\n- Add encoding and decoding of `use_srtp` hello extension to facilitate for `DTLS` users to implement `SRTP` functionality.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [readme](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_26.0.readme)\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n",

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 26.0-rc3 is the third and final release candidate before the OTP 26.0 release. \r\nThis release candidate fixes some bugs found in the first two release candidates.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-26.0-rc3) release and you can view the new documentation at https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-14.0-rc3/doc/. You can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this: kerl build 26.0-rc3 26.0-rc3.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 26 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n# Highlights RC2\r\n\r\n## Parsetools\r\n\r\n- `Leex` has been extended with optional column number support.\r\n\r\n## Stdlib\r\n\r\n- The family of enumeration functions in module `lists` has been extended with\r\n    `enumerate/3` that allows a step value to be supplied.\r\n- Update Unicode to version 15.0.0.\r\n- `proc_lib:start*/*` has become synchronous when the\r\n    started process fails. This requires that a failing\r\n    process use a new function `proc_lib:init_fail/2,3`, or\r\n    exits, to indicate failure. All OTP behaviours have\r\n    been fixed to do this.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Added the new built-in type `dynamic()` introduced in [EEP 61](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0061), [PR introducing EEP 61](https://github.com/erlang/eep/pull/44) improving support for gradual type checkers.\r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Change the client default `verify` option to `verify_peer`.\r\n    *Note* that this makes it mandatory to also supply trusted CA certificates or explicitly set\r\n    `verify` to `verify_none`. This also applies when using the so called\r\n    anonymous test cipher suites defined in TLS versions pre TLS-1.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Highlights RC1\r\n\r\n## The Shell\r\nThere are a lot of new features and improvements in the Erlang shell:\r\n- auto-complete of variables, record names, record fields names, map keys, function parameter types and filenames.\r\n- Open external editor in the shell to edit\r\n  the current expression.\r\n- defining records (with types), functions, specs and types in the shell.\r\n\r\n## New terminal\r\n- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten.\r\n  Windows users will notice that `erl.exe` has the same\r\n  functionality as a normal Unix shell and that `werl.exe` is just a \r\n  symlink to `erl.exe`. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal\r\n  experience identical to that of Unix.\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of binaries with segments of fixed sizes have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of UTF-8 segments have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Appending to binaries has been optimized.\r\n\r\n- The compiler and JIT now generate better code for creation of small maps where all keys \r\n  are literals known at compile time.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to the optimizations above the performance of the `base64` module has been\r\n  significantly improved. For example, on an x86_64 system with the JIT both encode and \r\n  decode are almost three times faster than in Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\n- Map comprehensions as suggested in [EEP 58](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0058) has now been\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n- Some map operations have been optimized by changing the\r\n  internal sort order of atom keys. This changes the\r\n  (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small maps are\r\n  printed and returned by `maps:to_list/1` and `maps:next/1`.\r\n  The new order is unpredictable and may change between\r\n  different invocations of the Erlang VM.\r\n\r\n- Introducing the new function `maps:iterator/2` for creating an interator\r\n  that return the map elements in a deterministic order.\r\n  There are also new modifiers `k` and `K` for the format\r\n  string in `io:format()` to support printing map elements\r\n  ordered.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Dialyzer has a new incremental mode that be invoked by\r\n  giving the `--incremental` option when running Dialyzer.\r\n  This new incremental mode is likely to become the\r\n  default in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Misc ERTS, Stdlib, Kernel, Compiler\r\n- Multi [time warp mode](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-modes) is now enabled by default.\r\n  This assumes that all code executing on the system is \r\n  [time warp safe](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-safe-code).\r\n\r\n- Support for UTF-8 atoms and strings in the NIF\r\n  interface including new functions `enif_make_new_atom`,\r\n  `enif_make_new_atom_len` and `enif_get_string_length`.\r\n\r\n- The BIFs `min/2` and `max/2` are now allowed to be used in\r\n  guards and match specs.\r\n\r\n- Improved the selective receive optimization, which can\r\n  now be enabled for references returned from other\r\n  functions. This greatly improves the performance of\r\n  `gen_server:send_request/3`, `gen_server:wait_response/2`,\r\n  and similar functions.\r\n\r\n- New trace feature `call_memory`. Similar to `call_time`\r\n  tracing, but instead of measure accumulated time in\r\n  traced functions it measures accumulated heap space\r\n  consumed by traced functions. It can be used to compare\r\n  how much different functions are contributing to\r\n  garbage collection being triggered.\r\n\r\n- It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the\r\n  runtime system in order to load modules that are using\r\n  it. It is sufficient to enable the feature in the\r\n  compiler when compiling it.\r\n\r\n- `inet:setopts/2` has got 3 new options: `reuseport`, `reuseport_lb` and `exclusiveaddruse`.\r\n\r\n- Fix so that `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` is applied to all\r\n  of the Erlang VM when using the JIT so that tools, such\r\n  as `perf`, can crawl the process stacks.\r\n\r\n- In the `lists` module, the zip family of functions now takes\r\noptions to allow handling lists of different lengths.\r\n\r\n- Added the `zip:zip_get_crc32/2` function to retrieve the\r\n  `CRC32` checksum from an opened ZIP archive.\r\n`gen_server` optimized by caching callback functions\r\n\r\n- The modules Erlang DNS resolver `inet_res` and helper\r\nmodules have been updated for RFC6891; to handle OPT RR\r\nwith DNSSEC OK (DO) bit.\r\n\r\n- Introduced `application:get_supervisor/1`.\r\n\r\n- Cache OTP boot code paths, to limit how many folders\r\nthat are being accessed during a module lookup. Can be\r\ndisabled with `-cache_boot_path false`. \r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the\r\nSSL application, for TLS distribution (`-proto_dist`\r\n`inet_tls`), the SSL option `{ktls, true}`. \r\n- Improved error checking and handling of ssl options.\r\n- Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by\r\n  lowering the maximum handshake size. This should not\r\n  effect the common cases, if needed it can be configured\r\n  to a higher value.\r\n\r\n- For security reasons the `SHA1` and `DSA`\r\n  algorithms are no longer among the default values.\r\n\r\n- Add encoding and decoding of `use_srtp` hello extension\r\n  to facilitate for `DTLS` users to implement `SRTP`\r\n  functionality.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [readme](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_26.0-rc3.readme)\r\n",

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 26.0-rc2 is the second release candidate of three before the OTP 26.0 release. The release candidate 2 fixes some bugs found in the first release candidate and there are also a few additional features.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-26.0-rc2) release and you can view the new documentation at https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-14.0-rc2/doc/. You can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this: kerl build 26.0-rc2 26.0-rc2.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 26 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n# Highlights RC2\r\n\r\n## Parsetools\r\n\r\n- `Leex` has been extended with optional column number support.\r\n\r\n## Stdlib\r\n\r\n- The family of enumeration functions in module `lists` has been extended with\r\n    `enumerate/3` that allows a step value to be supplied.\r\n- Update Unicode to version 15.0.0.\r\n- `proc_lib:start*/*` has become synchronous when the\r\n    started process fails. This requires that a failing\r\n    process use a new function `proc_lib:init_fail/2,3`, or\r\n    exits, to indicate failure. All OTP behaviours have\r\n    been fixed to do this.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Added the new built-in type `dynamic()` introduced in [EEP 61](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0061), [PR introducing EEP 61](https://github.com/erlang/eep/pull/44) improving support for gradual type checkers.\r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Change the client default `verify` option to `verify_peer`.\r\n    *Note* that this makes it mandatory to also supply trusted CA certificates or explicitly set\r\n    `verify` to `verify_none`. This also applies when using the so called\r\n    anonymous test cipher suites defined in TLS versions pre TLS-1.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Highlights RC1\r\n\r\n## The Shell\r\nThere are a lot of new features and improvements in the Erlang shell:\r\n- auto-complete of variables, record names, record fields names, map keys, function parameter types and filenames.\r\n- Open external editor in the shell to edit\r\n  the current expression.\r\n- defining records (with types), functions, specs and types in the shell.\r\n\r\n## New terminal\r\n- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten.\r\n  Windows users will notice that `erl.exe` has the same\r\n  functionality as a normal Unix shell and that `werl.exe` is just a \r\n  symlink to `erl.exe`. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal\r\n  experience identical to that of Unix.\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of binaries with segments of fixed sizes have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of UTF-8 segments have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Appending to binaries has been optimized.\r\n\r\n- The compiler and JIT now generate better code for creation of small maps where all keys \r\n  are literals known at compile time.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to the optimizations above the performance of the `base64` module has been\r\n  significantly improved. For example, on an x86_64 system with the JIT both encode and \r\n  decode are almost three times faster than in Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\n- Map comprehensions as suggested in [EEP 58](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0058) has now been\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n- Some map operations have been optimized by changing the\r\n  internal sort order of atom keys. This changes the\r\n  (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small maps are\r\n  printed and returned by `maps:to_list/1` and `maps:next/1`.\r\n  The new order is unpredictable and may change between\r\n  different invocations of the Erlang VM.\r\n\r\n- Introducing the new function `maps:iterator/2` for creating an interator\r\n  that return the map elements in a deterministic order.\r\n  There are also new modifiers `k` and `K` for the format\r\n  string in `io:format()` to support printing map elements\r\n  ordered.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Dialyzer has a new incremental mode that be invoked by\r\n  giving the `--incremental` option when running Dialyzer.\r\n  This new incremental mode is likely to become the\r\n  default in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Misc ERTS, Stdlib, Kernel, Compiler\r\n- Multi [time warp mode](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-modes) is now enabled by default.\r\n  This assumes that all code executing on the system is \r\n  [time warp safe](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-safe-code).\r\n\r\n- Support for UTF-8 atoms and strings in the NIF\r\n  interface including new functions `enif_make_new_atom`,\r\n  `enif_make_new_atom_len` and `enif_get_string_length`.\r\n\r\n- The BIFs `min/2` and `max/2` are now allowed to be used in\r\n  guards and match specs.\r\n\r\n- Improved the selective receive optimization, which can\r\n  now be enabled for references returned from other\r\n  functions. This greatly improves the performance of\r\n  `gen_server:send_request/3`, `gen_server:wait_response/2`,\r\n  and similar functions.\r\n\r\n- New trace feature `call_memory`. Similar to `call_time`\r\n  tracing, but instead of measure accumulated time in\r\n  traced functions it measures accumulated heap space\r\n  consumed by traced functions. It can be used to compare\r\n  how much different functions are contributing to\r\n  garbage collection being triggered.\r\n\r\n- It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the\r\n  runtime system in order to load modules that are using\r\n  it. It is sufficient to enable the feature in the\r\n  compiler when compiling it.\r\n\r\n- `inet:setopts/2` has got 3 new options: `reuseport`, `reuseport_lb` and `exclusiveaddruse`.\r\n\r\n- Fix so that `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` is applied to all\r\n  of the Erlang VM when using the JIT so that tools, such\r\n  as `perf`, can crawl the process stacks.\r\n\r\n- In the `lists` module, the zip family of functions now takes\r\noptions to allow handling lists of different lengths.\r\n\r\n- Added the `zip:zip_get_crc32/2` function to retrieve the\r\n  `CRC32` checksum from an opened ZIP archive.\r\n`gen_server` optimized by caching callback functions\r\n\r\n- The modules Erlang DNS resolver `inet_res` and helper\r\nmodules have been updated for RFC6891; to handle OPT RR\r\nwith DNSSEC OK (DO) bit.\r\n\r\n- Introduced `application:get_supervisor/1`.\r\n\r\n- Cache OTP boot code paths, to limit how many folders\r\nthat are being accessed during a module lookup. Can be\r\ndisabled with `-cache_boot_path false`. \r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the\r\nSSL application, for TLS distribution (`-proto_dist`\r\n`inet_tls`), the SSL option `{ktls, true}`. \r\n- Improved error checking and handling of ssl options.\r\n- Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by\r\n  lowering the maximum handshake size. This should not\r\n  effect the common cases, if needed it can be configured\r\n  to a higher value.\r\n\r\n- For security reasons the `SHA1` and `DSA`\r\n  algorithms are no longer among the default values.\r\n\r\n- Add encoding and decoding of `use_srtp` hello extension\r\n  to facilitate for `DTLS` users to implement `SRTP`\r\n  functionality.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [readme](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_26.0-rc2.readme)\r\n",

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 26.0-rc1 is the first release candidate of three before the OTP 26.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com/).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-26.0-rc1) release and you can view the new documentation at https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-14.0-rc1/doc/. You can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this: kerl build 26.0-rc1 26.0-rc1.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 26 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\n## The Shell\r\nThere are a lot of new features and improvements in the Erlang shell:\r\n- auto-complete of variables, record names, record fields names, map keys, function parameter types and filenames.\r\n- Open external editor in the shell to edit\r\n  the current expression.\r\n- defining records (with types), functions, specs and types in the shell.\r\n\r\n## New terminal\r\n- The TTY/terminal subsystem has been rewritten.\r\n  Windows users will notice that `erl.exe` has the same\r\n  functionality as a normal Unix shell and that `werl.exe` is just a \r\n  symlink to `erl.exe`. This makes the Windows Erlang terminal\r\n  experience identical to that of Unix.\r\n\r\n## Compiler and JIT optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of binaries with segments of fixed sizes have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Creation and matching of UTF-8 segments have been optimized.\r\n\r\n- Appending to binaries has been optimized.\r\n\r\n- The compiler and JIT now generate better code for creation of small maps where all keys \r\n  are literals known at compile time.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to the optimizations above the performance of the `base64` module has been\r\n  significantly improved. For example, on an x86_64 system with the JIT both encode and \r\n  decode are almost three times faster than in Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\n- Map comprehensions as suggested in [EEP 58](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0058) has now been\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n- Some map operations have been optimized by changing the\r\n  internal sort order of atom keys. This changes the\r\n  (undocumented) order of how atom keys in small maps are\r\n  printed and returned by `maps:to_list/1` and `maps:next/1`.\r\n  The new order is unpredictable and may change between\r\n  different invocations of the Erlang VM.\r\n\r\n- Introducing the new function `maps:iterator/2` for creating an interator\r\n  that return the map elements in a deterministic order.\r\n  There are also new modifiers `k` and `K` for the format\r\n  string in `io:format()` to support printing map elements\r\n  ordered.\r\n\r\n## Dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Dialyzer has a new incremental mode that be invoked by\r\n  giving the `--incremental` option when running Dialyzer.\r\n  This new incremental mode is likely to become the\r\n  default in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Misc ERTS, Stdlib, Kernel, Compiler\r\n- Multi [time warp mode](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-modes) is now enabled by default.\r\n  This assumes that all code executing on the system is \r\n  [time warp safe](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#time-warp-safe-code).\r\n\r\n- Support for UTF-8 atoms and strings in the NIF\r\n  interface including new functions `enif_make_new_atom`,\r\n  `enif_make_new_atom_len` and `enif_get_string_length`.\r\n\r\n- The BIFs `min/2` and `max/2` are now allowed to be used in\r\n  guards and match specs.\r\n\r\n- Improved the selective receive optimization, which can\r\n  now be enabled for references returned from other\r\n  functions. This greatly improves the performance of\r\n  `gen_server:send_request/3`, `gen_server:wait_response/2`,\r\n  and similar functions.\r\n\r\n- New trace feature `call_memory`. Similar to `call_time`\r\n  tracing, but instead of measure accumulated time in\r\n  traced functions it measures accumulated heap space\r\n  consumed by traced functions. It can be used to compare\r\n  how much different functions are contributing to\r\n  garbage collection being triggered.\r\n\r\n- It is no longer necessary to enable a feature in the\r\n  runtime system in order to load modules that are using\r\n  it. It is sufficient to enable the feature in the\r\n  compiler when compiling it.\r\n\r\n- `inet:setopts/2` has got 3 new options: `reuseport`, `reuseport_lb` and `exclusiveaddruse`.\r\n\r\n- Fix so that `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` is applied to all\r\n  of the Erlang VM when using the JIT so that tools, such\r\n  as `perf`, can crawl the process stacks.\r\n\r\n- In the `lists` module, the zip family of functions now takes\r\noptions to allow handling lists of different lengths.\r\n\r\n- Added the `zip:zip_get_crc32/2` function to retrieve the\r\n  `CRC32` checksum from an opened ZIP archive.\r\n`gen_server` optimized by caching callback functions\r\n\r\n- The modules Erlang DNS resolver `inet_res` and helper\r\nmodules have been updated for RFC6891; to handle OPT RR\r\nwith DNSSEC OK (DO) bit.\r\n\r\n- Introduced `application:get_supervisor/1`.\r\n\r\n- Cache OTP boot code paths, to limit how many folders\r\nthat are being accessed during a module lookup. Can be\r\ndisabled with `-cache_boot_path false`. \r\n\r\n## SSL\r\n\r\n- Support for Kernel TLS (kTLS), has been added to the\r\nSSL application, for TLS distribution (`-proto_dist`\r\n`inet_tls`), the SSL option `{ktls, true}`. \r\n- Improved error checking and handling of ssl options.\r\n- Mitigate memory usage from large certificate chains by\r\n  lowering the maximum handshake size. This should not\r\n  effect the common cases, if needed it can be configured\r\n  to a higher value.\r\n\r\n- For security reasons the `SHA1` and `DSA`\r\n  algorithms are no longer among the default values.\r\n\r\n- Add encoding and decoding of `use_srtp` hello extension\r\n  to facilitate for `DTLS` users to implement `SRTP`\r\n  functionality.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see the [readme](https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_26.0-rc1.readme)\r\n",

    "body": "## OTP 25.1\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 25.1 is the first maintenance patch package for OTP 25, with mostly bug fixes as well as quite many small improvements.\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n### crypto:\r\n- Crypto is now considered to be usable with the OpenSSL\r\n  3.0 cryptolib for production code.\r\n  ENGINE and FIPS are not yet fully functional.\r\n\r\n- Changed the behaviour of the engine load/unload\r\n    functions\r\n\r\n\r\n### ssl:\r\n- A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected. It\r\n  is registered as CVE-2022-37026 \"Client Authentication\r\n  Bypass\". Corrections have been released on the\r\n  supported tracks with patches 23.3.4.15, 24.3.4.2, and\r\n  25.0.2. The vulnerability might also exist in older OTP\r\n  versions. We recommend that impacted users upgrade to\r\n  one of these versions or later on the respective\r\n  tracks. OTP 25.1 would be an even better choice.\r\n  Impacted are those who are running an `ssl/tls/dtls`\r\n  server using the `ssl` application either directly or\r\n  indirectly via other applications. For example via\r\n  `inets` (`httpd`), `cowboy`, etc. Note that the vulnerability\r\n  only affects servers that request client certification,\r\n  that is sets the option `{verify, verify_peer}`.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[For more details and downloads follow this link](https://erlang.org/patches/OTP-25.1)\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n",

    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\n### stdlib\r\n\r\n- New function `filelib:ensure_path/1` will ensure that all directories for the given path exists\r\n- New functions  `groups_from_list/2` and `groups_from_list/3` in the `maps` module\r\n- New functions  `uniq/1` `uniq/2` in the `lists` module\r\n- New PRNG added to the `rand` module, for fast pseudo-random numers.\r\n\r\n### compiler, kernel, stdlib, syntax_tools\r\n\r\n- Added support for selectable features as described in [`EEP-60`](/eeps/eep-0060). Features can be enabled/disabled during compilation with options (ordinary and +term) to `erlc` as well as with directives in the file. Similar options can be used to `erl` for enabling/disabling features allowed at runtime. The new `maybe` expression [`EEP-49`](/eeps/eep-0049) is fully supported as the feature maybe_expr.\r\n\r\n### erts & JIT\r\n\r\n- The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.\r\n- The JIT now does type-based optimizations based on type information in the BEAM files.\r\n- Improved the JIT's support for external tools like `perf` and `gdb`, allowing them to show line numbers and even the original Erlang source code when that can be found.\r\n\r\n### erts, stdlib, kernel\r\n\r\n- Users can now configure ETS tables with the `{write_concurrency, auto}` option. This option forces tables to automatically change the number of locks that are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency is detected. The `{decentralized_counters, true}` option is enabled by default when `{write_concurrency, auto}` is active.  \r\n  Benchmark results comparing this option with the other ETS optimization options are available here: [benchmarks](/bench/ets_bench_result_lock_config.html).\r\n- To enable more optimizations, BEAM files compiled with OTP 21 and earlier cannot be loaded in OTP 25.\r\n- The signal queue of a process with the process flag `message_queue_data=off_heap` has been optimized to allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes. This can improve performance when many processes are sending in parallel to one process. [See benchmark](/bench/sigq_bench_result.html).\r\n- The Erlang installation directory is now relocatable on the file system given that the paths in the installation's RELEASES file are paths that are relative to the installations root directory.\r\n- A new option called `short` has been added to the functions `erlang:float_to_list/2` and `erlang:float_to_binary/2`. This option creates the shortest correctly rounded string representation of the given float that can be converted back to the same float again.\r\n- Introduction of `quote/1` and `unquote/1` functions in the `uri_string` module - a replacement for the deprecated functions `http_uri:encode` and `http_uri:decode`.\r\n- The new module `peer` supersedes the `slave` module. The `slave` module is now deprecated and will be removed in OTP 27.\r\n- `global` will now by default prevent overlapping partitions due to network issues. This is done by actively disconnecting from nodes that reports that they have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving the network in a state with overlapping partitions.  \r\n  It is possible to turn off the new behavior by setting the the `kernel` configuration parameter `prevent_overlapping_partitions` to `false`. Doing this will retain the same behavior as in OTP 24 and earlier.\r\n- The `format_status/2` callback for `gen_server`, `gen_statem` and `gen_event` has been deprecated in favor of the new `format_status/1` callback.  \r\n  The new callback adds the possibility to limit and change many more things than the just the state.\r\n- The `timer` module has been modernized and made more efficient, which makes the timer server less susceptible to being overloaded. The `timer:sleep/1` function now accepts an arbitrarily large integer.\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n\r\n- The `maybe ... end` construction as proposed in [`EEP-49`](/eeps/eep-0049) has been implemented. It can simplify complex code where otherwise deeply nested cases would have to be used.  \r\n  To enable `maybe`, give the option `{enable_feature,maybe_expr}` to the compiler. The exact option to use will change in a coming release candidate and then it will also be possible to use from inside the module being compiled.\r\n- When a record matching or record update fails, a `{badrecord, ExpectedRecordTag}` exception used to be raised. In this release, the exception has been changed to `{badrecord, ActualValue}`, where `ActualValue` is the value that was found instead of the expected record.\r\n- Add compile attribute `-nifs()` to empower compiler and loader with information about which functions may be overridden as NIFs by `erlang:load_nif/2`.\r\n- Improved and more detailed error messages when binary construction with the binary syntax fails. This applies both for error messages in the shell and for `erl_error:format_exception/3,4`.\r\n- Change format of feature options and directives for better consistency. Options to erlc and the `-compile(..)` directive now has the format `{feature, feature-name, enable | disable}`. The `-feature(..)` now has the format `-feature(feature-name, enable | disable)`.\r\n\r\n### crypto\r\n\r\n- Add `crypto:hash_equals/2` which is a constant time comparision of hashvalues.\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n\r\n- Introducing a new (still experimental) option `{certs_keys,[cert_key_conf()]}`. With this a list of a certificates with their associated key may be used to authenticate the client or the server. The certificate key pair that is considered best and matches negotiated parameters for the connection will be selected.\r\n\r\n### public_key\r\n\r\n- Functions for retrieving OS provided CA-certs added.\r\n\r\n### dialyzer\r\n\r\n- Optimize operations in the `erl_types` module. Parallelize the Dialyzer pass remote.\r\n- Added the `missing_return` and `extra_return` options to raise warnings when specifications differ from inferred types. These are similar to, but not quite as verbose as overspecs and underspecs.\r\n- Dialyzer now better understands the types for `min/2`, `max/2`, and `erlang:raise/3`. Because of that, Dialyzer can potentially generate new warnings. In particular, functions that use `erlang:raise/3` could now need a spec with a `no_return()` return type to avoid an unwanted warning.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- A new [DEVELOPMENT HOWTO guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/HOWTO/DEVELOPMENT.md) has been added that describes how to build and test Erlang/OTP when fixing bugs or developing new functionality.\r\n- Testing has been added to the Github actions run for each opened PR so that more bugs are caught earlier when bug fixes and new features are proposed.\r\n",

The erts-11.2.2.13 application *cannot* be applied\n       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 23\n       installation.\n\n       On a full OTP 23 installation, also the following runtime\n       dependency has to be satisfied:\n       -- kernel-7.3.1.5 (first satisfied in OTP 23.3.4.12)\n\n\n --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---\n\n  OTP-17970    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-5762\n\n               Let EPMD tolerate failure when binding to IPv4/IPv6\n               loopback intefaces in addition to user-supplied\n               addresses via ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS or the -address option.\n               This can happen, for example, if the host system has\n               ipv6 disabled via the disable_ipv6 sysctl.\n\n\n  OTP-18027    Application(s): erts\n\n               Fixed a rare bug in binary_to_term/1,\n               enif_make_map_from_arrays, erl_drv_send_term, and\n               Erlang distribution that could crash the emulator.\n\n\n  OTP-18065    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): GH-5908\n\n               Fixed a rare race in persistent_term:get/1,2 that could\n               cause it to return the value of another key.\n\n\n  OTP-18075    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-5927\n\n               Fix bug where the process message queue was left in an\n               inconsistent state when changing from on_heap to\n               off_heap message queue data causing the GC to segfault.\n\n\n  OTP-18076    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): ERIERL-802, PR-5905\n\n               Fix functions that convert universal to localtime (such\n               as erlang:localtime/0 and\n               erlang:universaltime_to_localtime/1) to fetch the\n               correct localtime if it is changed after the start of\n               the VM.\n\n\n  OTP-18077    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): GH-5876, PR-5892\n\n               Fix memory leak when a process doing a distributed\n               fragmented send is sent an exit signal. Before this fix\n               the receiving node would be left with an incomplete\n               message that would remain until the nodes were\n               disconnected.

This option forces\n               tables to automatically change the number of locks that\n               are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency\n               is detected. The {decentralized_counters, true} option\n               is enabled by default when {write_concurrency, auto} is\n               active.\n\n               Benchmark results comparing this option with the other\n               ETS optimization options are available here:\n\n               https://erlang.org/bench/ets_bench_result_lock_config.html\n\n\n  OTP-16702    Application(s): compiler, erts\n\n               To enable more optimizations, BEAM files compiled with\n               OTP 21 and earlier cannot be loaded in OTP 25.\n\n\n  OTP-16982    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-5020\n\n               The signal queue of a process with\n               message_queue_data=off_heap* has been optimized to\n               allow parallel reception of signals from multiple\n               processes.\n\n               This is possible to do as Erlang only guarantees that\n               signals (i.e., message signals and non-message signals)\n               sent from a single process to another process are\n               ordered in send order. However, there are no ordering\n               guarantees for signals sent from different processes to\n               a particular process. Therefore, several processes can\n               send signals in parallel to a specific process without\n               synchronizing with each other. However, such signal\n               sending was previously always serialized as the senders\n               had to acquire the lock for the outer signal queue of\n               the receiving process. This parallel signal sending\n               optimization yields much better scalability for signal\n               sending than what was previously possible, see\n               https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html for\n               benchmark results.\n\n               * Information about how to enable the\n               message_queue_data=off_heap setting can be found in the\n               documentation of the function erlang:process_flag/2.\n\n\n  OTP-17119    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-4869\n\n               The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.\n\n\n  OTP-17151    Application(s): compiler, erts\n               Related Id(s): ERIERL-590, PR-5479\n\n               Added support for the compile attribute -nifs() to\n               empower compiler and loader with information about\n               which functions may be overridden as NIFs by\n               erlang:load_nif/2.

This will\n               cause fully connected partitions to form instead of\n               leaving the network in a state with overlapping\n               partitions.\n\n               Prevention of overlapping partitions can be disabled\n               using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6)\n               parameter, making global behave like it used to do.\n               This is, however, problematic for all applications\n               expecting a fully connected network to be provided,\n               such as for example mnesia, but also for global itself.\n               A network of overlapping partitions might cause the\n               internal state of global to become inconsistent. Such\n               an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions\n               have been brought together to form a fully connected\n               network again. The effect on other applications that\n               expects that a fully connected network is maintained\n               may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard\n               to detect ways during such a partitioning. Since you\n               might get hard to detect issues without this fix, you\n               are strongly advised not to disable this fix.

This will\n               cause fully connected partitions to form instead of\n               leaving the network in a state with overlapping\n               partitions.\n\n               Prevention of overlapping partitions can be disabled\n               using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6)\n               parameter, making global behave like it used to do.\n               This is, however, problematic for all applications\n               expecting a fully connected network to be provided,\n               such as for example mnesia, but also for global itself.\n               A network of overlapping partitions might cause the\n               internal state of global to become inconsistent. Such\n               an inconsistency can remain even after such partitions\n               have been brought together to form a fully connected\n               network again. The effect on other applications that\n               expects that a fully connected network is maintained\n               may vary, but they might misbehave in very subtle hard\n               to detect ways during such a partitioning. Since you\n               might get hard to detect issues without this fix, you\n               are strongly advised not to disable this fix. Also note\n               that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in the\n               network in order to work properly.\n\n\n  OTP-17920    Application(s): ssh\n\n               The representation of Edward curves (ed25519 and ed448)\n               inside ssh had a temporary representation (ed_pri and\n               ed_pub).\n\n               That is now changed to the public_key form. See the\n               manual for more information.\n\n\n  OTP-17921    Application(s): public_key\n\n               The deprecated public_key functions ssh_decode/2,\n               ssh_encode/2, ssh_hostkey_fingerprint/1 and\n               ssh_hostkey_fingerprint/2 are removed.\n\n               They are replaced by ssh_file:decode/2,\n               ssh_file:encode/2, ssh:hostkey_fingerprint/1 and\n               ssh:hostkey_fingerprint/2 respectively.\n\n               Note that the decode/2 and encode/2 are not exact\n               replacement functions, some minor changes may be\n               needed. Se the manual for more information.\n\n\n  OTP-17925    Application(s): stdlib\n               Related Id(s): PR-5631\n\n               The non-local function handler for the erl_eval can now\n               be called with either two or three arguments. When\n               called with three arguments, the first argument is the\n               annotation for the node in the abstract format.\n\n               All errors during evaluation will now be passed through\n               erlang:raise/3. If the restricted shell is active and\n               it does not let erlang:raise/3 through, evaluation\n               errors will be printed in less clear way. See the\n               documentation for restricted shell in shell.\n\n\n  OTP-17950    Application(s): wx\n\n               Added aux1Down and aux2Down fields to the wxMouseState\n               record. Since one record have been changed a\n               recompilation of user code might be required.\n\n\n  OTP-17965    Application(s): crypto\n\n               The infomation in error messages are increased.\n\n               Previously the error was signaled with en error class\n               exception badarg, notsup or error, and also in some\n               more ways like an other exception or a return value in\n               a non-standardized format.\n\n               Now it is an error-class exception\n               {notsup|badarg|error, InfoFromCfile,\n               Description::string()}.\n\n               The InfoFromCfile is a term with name and line number\n               of the C-file where the error was found. This is\n               primarily intended for a crypto maitntainer or an\n               advanced user to find the cause of complicated errors -\n               maybe in crypto itself. The contents of that term might\n               be changed in the future.\n\n               The Description is a clear text string that describes\n               the error. In case of badarg and notsup the intention\n               is that it should help the user to find the cause (\"Bad\n               key size\" as an example). Specially for some error that\n               are unlikely, the string may not be possible to\n               understand without deep knowledge of the underlying\n               cryptolib. Such messages are intended for a crypto\n               maintainer.\n\n               The first element on call stack (the S in try ... catch\n               error:E:S .... end) gives more information like the\n               actual argument list in the call of crypto and the\n               argument number (if possible) in the call to the NIF\n               inside crypto.\n\n               The functions in crypto affected by this change are:\n\n               sign/4, sign/5, verify/5, verify/6,\n\n               generate_key/2, generate_key/3, compute_key/4,\n\n               hash/2, hash/4, hash_init/1, hash_update/4,\n               hash_final/1,\n\n               mac/3,4, mac_init/3, mac_update/2, mac_final/2,\n\n               pbkdf2_hmac/5,\n\n               public_encrypt/4, private_decrypt/4, private_encrypt/4,\n               public_decrypt/4\n\n               This schema was introduced earlier in:\n\n               crypto_init/3, crypto_init/4, crypto_update/2,\n               crypto_final/1, crypto_get_data/1,\n\n               crypto_one_time/4, crypto_one_time/5,\n               crypto_one_time_aead/6, crypto_one_time_aead/7\n\n\n  OTP-17991    Application(s): stdlib\n\n               The function filename:safe_relative_path/1, which has\n               been deprecated since OTP 25, has been removed. Use\n               filelib:safe_relative_path/2 instead.\n\n\n  OTP-18009    Application(s): stdlib\n               Related Id(s): PR-5785\n\n               Fixed string:next_grapheme/1 to return an empty binary\n               in the tail for binary input for the last grapheme\n               cluster.\n```",

This is problematic for all\n               applications expecting a fully connected network to be\n               provided, such as for example mnesia, but also for\n               global itself. A network of overlapping partitions\n               might cause the internal state of global to become\n               inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even\n               after such partitions have been brought together to\n               form a fully connected network again. The effect on\n               other applications that expects that a fully connected\n               network is maintained may vary, but they might\n               misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during\n               such a partitioning.\n\n               In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a\n               prevent overlapping partitions fix which can be enabled\n               using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6)\n               parameter. When this fix has been enabled, global will\n               actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they\n               have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause\n               fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving\n               the network in a state with overlapping partitions.\n               Note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in\n               the network in order to work properly. Since this quite\n               substantially changes the behavior, this fix is\n               currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard\n               to detect issues without this fix you are, however,\n               strongly advised to enable this fix in order to avoid\n               issues such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25\n               this fix will become enabled by default.\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n --- common_test-1.18.2.2 --------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The common_test-1.18.2.2 application can be applied independently of\n other applications on a full OTP 22 installation.\n```",

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 25-rc2 is the second release candidate of three before the OTP 25.0 release. \r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here <https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues> or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com) or the mailing list [erlang-questions@erlang.org](mailto:erlang-questions@erlang.org).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-25.0-rc2) release and you can view the new documentation at <https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-13.0-rc2/doc/>. \r\nYou can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this: `kerl build 25.0-rc2 25.0-rc2`.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 25 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc2\r\n\r\n### stdlib\r\n\r\n- New function `filelib:ensure_path/1` will ensure that all directories for the given path exists\r\n- New functions  `groups_from_list/2` and `groups_from_list/3` in the `maps` module\r\n- New functions  `uniq/1` `uniq/2` in the lists module\r\n\r\n### compiler, kernel, stdlib, syntax_tools\r\n\r\n- Added support for selectable features as described in [`EEP-60`](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0060). Features can be enabled/disabled during compilation with options (ordinary and +term) to `erlc` as well as with directives in the file. Similar options\r\ncan be used to `erl` for enabling/disabling features\r\nallowed at runtime. The new `maybe` expression [`EEP-49`](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0049)\r\nis fully supported as the feature maybe_expr.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc1\r\n\r\n### erts & jit\r\n- The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.\r\n- The JIT now does type-based optimizations based on type\r\n  information in the BEAM files.\r\n- Improved the JIT's support for external tools like `perf`\r\n  and `gdb`, allowing them to show line numbers and even\r\n  the original Erlang source code when that can be found.\r\n\r\n### erts, stdlib, kernel\r\n- Users can now configure ETS tables with the\r\n  `{write_concurrency, auto}` option. This option forces\r\n  tables to automatically change the number of locks that\r\n  are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency\r\n  is detected. The `{decentralized_counters, true}` option\r\n  is enabled by default when `{write_concurrency, auto}` is\r\n  active.\r\n\r\n  Benchmark results comparing this option with the other\r\n  ETS optimization options are available here:\r\n  [benchmarks](https://erlang.org/bench/ets_bench_result_lock_config.html).\r\n- To enable more optimizations, BEAM files compiled with\r\n  OTP 21 and earlier cannot be loaded in OTP 25.\r\n- The signal queue of a process with\r\n  the process flag `message_queue_data=off_heap` has been optimized to\r\n  allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes.\r\n  This can improve performance when many processes are sending in parallel to\r\n  one process. [See benchmark](https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html).\r\n- The Erlang installation directory is now relocatable on\r\n  the file system given that the paths in the\r\n  installation's RELEASES file are paths that are\r\n  relative to the installations root directory. \r\n- A new option called `short` has been added to the\r\n  functions `erlang:float_to_list/2` and\r\n  `erlang:float_to_binary/2`. This option creates the\r\n  shortest correctly rounded string representation of the\r\n  given float that can be converted back to the same\r\n  float again.\r\n- Introduction of `quote/1` and `unquote/1` functions in\r\n  the `uri_string` module - a replacement for the deprecated functions `http_uri:encode`\r\n  and `http_uri:decode`.\r\n- The new module `peer` supersedes the `slave` module. The\r\n  `slave` module is now deprecated and will be removed in OTP 27.\r\n- `global` will now by default prevent\r\n  overlapping partitions due to network issues. This is done by\r\n  actively disconnecting from nodes that reports that\r\n  they have lost connections to other nodes. This will\r\n  cause fully connected partitions to form instead of\r\n  leaving the network in a state with overlapping\r\n  partitions.\r\n\r\n  It is possible to turn off the new behavior by setting the\r\n  the `kernel` configuration parameter `prevent_overlapping_partitions` to `false`.\r\n  Doing this will retain the same behavior as in OTP 24 and earlier.\r\n- The `format_status/2` callback for `gen_server`, `gen_statem`\r\n               and `gen_event` has been deprecated in favor of the new\r\n               `format_status/1` callback.\r\n\r\n  The new callback adds the possibility to limit and\r\n  change many more things than the just the state.\r\n- The `timer` module has been modernized and made more\r\n  efficient, which makes the timer server less\r\n  susceptible to being overloaded. The `timer:sleep/1`\r\n  function now accepts an arbitrarily large integer.\r\n\r\n### Compiler\r\n- The `maybe ... end` construction as proposed in [`EEP-49`](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0049)\r\n  has been implemented. It can simplify complex code\r\n  where otherwise deeply nested cases would have to be\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  To enable `maybe`, give the option `{enable_feature,maybe_expr}` to\r\n  the compiler. The exact option to use will change in a coming release candidate and then it will also be possible to\r\n  use from inside the module being compiled.\r\n- When a record matching or record update fails, a\r\n  `{badrecord, ExpectedRecordTag}` exception used to be\r\n  raised. In this release, the exception has been changed\r\n  to `{badrecord, ActualValue}`, where `ActualValue` is the\r\n  value that was found instead of the expected record.\r\n- Add compile attribute `-nifs()` to empower compiler and loader with\r\n  information about which functions may be overridden as NIFs by `erlang:load_nif/2`.\r\n- Improved and more detailed error messages when binary construction with the\r\n  binary syntax fails.\r\n  This applies both for error messages in the shell and for\r\n  `erl_error:format_exception/3,4`.\r\n\r\n### Crypto\r\n- Add `crypto:hash_equals/2` which is a constant time comparision of hashvalues.\r\n\r\n### Dialyzer\r\n- Optimize operations in the `erl_types` module. Parallelize the Dialyzer pass remote.\r\n- Added the `missing_return` and `extra_return` options to\r\n  raise warnings when specifications differ from inferred\r\n  types. These are similar to, but not quite as verbose\r\n  as overspecs and underspecs.\r\n- Dialyzer now better understands the types for `min/2`,\r\n  `max/2`, and `erlang:raise/3`. Because of that, Dialyzer\r\n  can potentially generate new warnings. In particular,\r\n  functions that use `erlang:raise/3` could now need a spec\r\n  with a `no_return()` return type to avoid an unwanted\r\n  warning.\r\n  \r\n### Misc\r\n- A new [DEVELOPMENT HOWTO guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/HOWTO/DEVELOPMENT.md) has been added that\r\n  describes how to build and test Erlang/OTP when fixing\r\n  bugs or developing new functionality.\r\n- Testing has been\r\n  added to the Github actions run for each opened PR so\r\n  that more bugs are caught earlier when bug fixes and\r\n  new features are proposed.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\n- <https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_25.0-rc2.readme>",

There are not yet any\n               guaranties that it works, not even together with other\n               OTP applications like for example SSL and SSH, although\n               there are no known errors.\n\n               Since the previous release, OTP-24.2, the following\n               improvements have been done:\n\n               - It has been tested during nearly every nightly test\n               on the OTP lab\n\n               - The hash algorithms md4 and ripemd160 have been\n               enabled with OpenSSL 3.0.\n\n               - The ciphers blowfish_cbc, blowfish_ecb, des_cbc,\n               des_cfb, des_ecb, rc2_cbc and rc4 have been enabled\n               with OpenSSL 3.0.\n\n               Disabled or unsupported with OpenSSL 3.0 are still:\n\n               - ENGINE support\n\n               - FIPS mode\n\n               - Other providers than the built-in ones\n\n               - Compiling and linking with OpenSSL 3.0 cryptolib in\n               compatibility modes (for example to behave as 1.1.1)\n\n               and, the ciphers blowfish_cfb64 and blowfish_ofb64 are\n               not supported and will not be either.\n\n               Deprecated functions in the OpenSSL 3.0 cryptolib must\n               not be disabled as OTP/crypto still uses some of the\n               deprecated API functions.

A network of overlapping partitions\n               might cause the internal state of global to become\n               inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even\n               after such partitions have been brought together to\n               form a fully connected network again. The effect on\n               other applications that expects that a fully connected\n               network is maintained may vary, but they might\n               misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during\n               such a partitioning.\n\n               In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a\n               prevent overlapping partitions fix which can be enabled\n               using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6)\n               parameter. When this fix has been enabled, global will\n               actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they\n               have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause\n               fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving\n               the network in a state with overlapping partitions.\n               Note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in\n               the network in order to work properly. Since this quite\n               substantially changes the behavior, this fix is\n               currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard\n               to detect issues without this fix you are, however,\n               strongly advised to enable this fix in order to avoid\n               issues such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25\n               this fix will become enabled by default.\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n --- POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITIES -------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  OTP-17928    Application(s): ssh\n               Related Id(s): PR-5679\n\n               Improper tag for private ED keys when encoding with\n               ssh:encode/2.\n\n               The tuple had ed_priv as first element, but should have\n               had ed_pri. This is now corrected.\n```"

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 25.0-rc1 is the first release candidate of three before the OTP 25.0 release. \r\n\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here <https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues> or by posting to [Erlangforums](https://erlangforums.com) or the mailing list [erlang-questions@erlang.org](mailto:erlang-questions@erlang.org).\r\n\r\nAll artifacts for the release can be downloaded from the [Erlang/OTP Github](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-25.0-rc1) release and you can view the new documentation at <https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-13.0-rc1/doc/>. You can also install the latest release using [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl) like this: `kerl build 25.0-rc1 25.0-rc1`.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 25 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new features are highlighted below.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all contributors!\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### erts & jit\r\n- The JIT now works for 64-bit ARM processors.\r\n- The JIT now does type-based optimizations based on type\r\n  information in the BEAM files.\r\n- Improved the JIT's support for external tools like `perf`\r\n  and `gdb`, allowing them to show line numbers and even\r\n  the original Erlang source code when that can be found.\r\n\r\n### erts, stdlib, kernel\r\n- Users can now configure ETS tables with the\r\n  `{write_concurrency, auto}` option. This option forces\r\n  tables to automatically change the number of locks that\r\n  are used at run-time depending on how much concurrency\r\n  is detected. The `{decentralized_counters, true}` option\r\n  is enabled by default when `{write_concurrency, auto}` is\r\n  active.\r\n\r\n  Benchmark results comparing this option with the other\r\n  ETS optimization options are available here:\r\n  [benchmarks](https://erlang.org/bench/ets_bench_result_lock_config.html).\r\n- To enable more optimizations, BEAM files compiled with\r\n  OTP 21 and earlier cannot be loaded in OTP 25.\r\n- The signal queue of a process with\r\n  the process flag `message_queue_data=off_heap` has been optimized to\r\n  allow parallel reception of signals from multiple processes.\r\n  This can improve performance when many processes are sending in parallel to\r\n  one process. [See benchmark](https://erlang.org/bench/sigq_bench_result.html).\r\n- The Erlang installation directory is now relocatable on\r\n  the file system given that the paths in the\r\n  installation's RELEASES file are paths that are\r\n  relative to the installations root directory. \r\n- A new option called `short` has been added to the\r\n  functions `erlang:float_to_list/2` and\r\n  `erlang:float_to_binary/2`. This option creates the\r\n  shortest correctly rounded string representation of the\r\n  given float that can be converted back to the same\r\n  float again.\r\n- Introduction of `quote/1` and `unquote/1` functions in\r\n  the `uri_string` module - a replacement for the deprecated functions `http_uri:encode`\r\n  and `http_uri:decode`.\r\n- The new module `peer` supersedes the `slave` module. The\r\n  `slave` module is now deprecated and will be removed in OTP 27.\r\n- `global` will now by default prevent\r\n  overlapping partitions due to network issues. This is done by\r\n  actively disconnecting from nodes that reports that\r\n  they have lost connections to other nodes. This will\r\n  cause fully connected partitions to form instead of\r\n  leaving the network in a state with overlapping\r\n  partitions.\r\n\r\n  It is possible to turn off the new behavior by setting the\r\n  the `kernel` configuration parameter `prevent_overlapping_partitions` to `false`.\r\n  Doing this will retain the same behavior as in OTP 24 and earlier.\r\n- The `format_status/2` callback for `gen_server`, `gen_statem`\r\n               and `gen_event` has been deprecated in favor of the new\r\n               `format_status/1` callback.\r\n\r\n  The new callback adds the possibility to limit and\r\n  change many more things than the just the state.\r\n- The `timer` module has been modernized and made more\r\n  efficient, which makes the timer server less\r\n  susceptible to being overloaded. The `timer:sleep/1`\r\n  function now accepts an arbitrarily large integer.\r\n\r\n### Compiler\r\n- The `maybe ... end` construction as proposed in [`EEP-49`](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0049)\r\n  has been implemented. It can simplify complex code\r\n  where otherwise deeply nested cases would have to be\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  To enable `maybe`, give the option `{enable_feature,maybe_expr}` to\r\n  the compiler. The exact option to use will change in a coming release candidate and then it will also be possible to\r\n  use from inside the module being compiled.\r\n- When a record matching or record update fails, a\r\n  `{badrecord, ExpectedRecordTag}` exception used to be\r\n  raised. In this release, the exception has been changed\r\n  to `{badrecord, ActualValue}`, where `ActualValue` is the\r\n  value that was found instead of the expected record.\r\n- Add compile attribute `-nifs()` to empower compiler and loader with\r\n  information about which functions may be overridden as NIFs by `erlang:load_nif/2`.\r\n- Improved and more detailed error messages when binary construction with the\r\n  binary syntax fails.\r\n  This applies both for error messages in the shell and for\r\n  `erl_error:format_exception/3,4`.\r\n\r\n### Crypto\r\n- Add `crypto:hash_equals/2` which is a constant time comparision of hashvalues.\r\n\r\n### Dialyzer\r\n- Optimize operations in the `erl_types` module. Parallelize the Dialyzer pass remote.\r\n- Added the `missing_return` and `extra_return` options to\r\n  raise warnings when specifications differ from inferred\r\n  types. These are similar to, but not quite as verbose\r\n  as overspecs and underspecs.\r\n- Dialyzer now better understands the types for `min/2`,\r\n  `max/2`, and `erlang:raise/3`. Because of that, Dialyzer\r\n  can potentially generate new warnings. In particular,\r\n  functions that use `erlang:raise/3` could now need a spec\r\n  with a `no_return()` return type to avoid an unwanted\r\n  warning.\r\n  \r\n### Misc\r\n- A new [DEVELOPMENT HOWTO guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/HOWTO/DEVELOPMENT.md) has been added that\r\n  describes how to build and test Erlang/OTP when fixing\r\n  bugs or developing new functionality.\r\n- Testing has been\r\n  added to the Github actions run for each opened PR so\r\n  that more bugs are caught earlier when bug fixes and\r\n  new features are proposed.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\n- <https://erlang.org/download/otp_src_25.0-rc1.readme>\r\n",

Another\n               fix for cipher suite handling in OTP-24.1 accidentally\n               excludes a few cipher suites from the listing of all\n               cipher suites.\n\n\n  OTP-17879    Application(s): ssl\n               Related Id(s): GH-5624\n\n               Reenable legacy cipher suite\n               TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA for explicit\n               configuration in TLS-1.2, not supported by default.\n\n\n --- Improvements and New Features ---\n\n  OTP-17831    Application(s): ssl\n\n               Avoid unnecessary logs by better adjusting the\n               tls_sender process to the new supervisor structure in\n               OTP-24.2\n\n\n Full runtime dependencies of ssl-10.6.1: crypto-5.0, erts-10.0,\n inets-5.10.7, kernel-8.0, public_key-1.11.3, runtime_tools-1.15.1,\n stdlib-3.12\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n```"

This since during these operations all\n               processes on the system were scheduled for execution at\n               once.\n\n               This problem has been fixed by introducing a limit on\n               outstanding purge and copy literal requests in the\n               system. By default this limit is set to twice the\n               amount of schedulers on the system. This will ensure\n               that schedulers will have enough work scheduled to\n               perform these operations as quickly as possible at the\n               same time as other work will be interleaved to a much\n               higher degree. Performance of these operations will\n               however be somewhat degraded due to the overhead of\n               enforcing this limit compared to when using a very\n               large limit.\n\n               This limit can be set by passing the +zosrl command\n               line argument to erl, or by calling\n               erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit,\n               NewLimit).\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n --- erts-10.7.2.16 --------------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Note! The erts-10.7.2.16 application *cannot* be applied\n       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22\n       installation.\n\n       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime\n       dependency has to be satisfied:\n       -- kernel-6.5.1 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2)\n```"

    "body": "Erlang/OTP 24.2 is the second maintenance patch release for OTP 24, with mostly\r\nbug fixes as well as a few improvements.\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- **crypto**: The `crypto` app in OTP can now be compiled, linked and\r\n               used with the new `OpenSSL 3.0` cryptolib. It has not yet been extensively tested, \r\n               so only recommended for experiments and alpha testing in this release. \r\n               There are not yet any guaranties that it works, not even together with other\r\n               OTP applications like for example SSL and SSH, although\r\n               there are no known errors.\r\n- **erts**: An option for enabling dirty scheduler specific\r\n               allocator instances has been introduced. By default\r\n               such allocator instances are disabled. For more\r\n               information see the documentation of the `+Mdai` argument\r\n               to the `erl`command\r\n\r\n- **erl_docgen, erts**: All predefined types have been added to the `erlang`\r\n              module together with documentation.\r\n              Any reference to a predefined type now links to that\r\n              documentation so that the user can view it.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: Responsiveness of processes executing on normal or low\r\n               priority could suffer due to code purging or literal\r\n               area removal on systems with a huge amount of\r\n               processes. This since during these operations all\r\n               processes on the system were scheduled for execution at\r\n               once. The new solution is to limit the number of outstanding \r\n               purge and copy requests to 2 times the number of schedulers as default\r\n\r\nFor more details about the new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.2.README\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttps://www.erlang.org/docs/24/\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

The bugs were\n               only triggered if the monitor that was removed by\n               demonitor() had previously been created simultaneously\n               as a monitor and as an alias.\n\n               -- A demonitor operation on a monitor created using the\n               {alias, reply_demonitor} option erroneously behaved as\n               if the {alias, explicit_unalias} option had been used.\n\n               -- A demonitor operation did not prevent a\n               corresponding 'DOWN' message from being delivered if\n               the monitor reference was kept as an active alias after\n               the operation. This could only occur if the monitored\n               process simultaneously terminated before the demonitor\n               signal reached it, and the exit reason was not an\n               immediate term.

Apply one or more applications from this\n build as patches to your installation using the 'otp_patch_apply'\n tool. For information on install requirements, see descriptions for\n each application version below.\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n --- erts-10.7.2.14 --------------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Note! The erts-10.7.2.14 application *cannot* be applied\n       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22\n       installation.\n\n       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime\n       dependency has to be satisfied:\n       -- kernel-6.5.1 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2)\n\n\n --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---\n\n  OTP-17604    Application(s): erts\n\n               On 32-bit computers, binary_to_term/1,2 is now more\n               resilient against corrupted binaries containing maps in\n               the external format.\n\n\n  OTP-17628    Application(s): erts\n\n               A call to process_info(Pid, status) could erroneously\n               report the status running when it should have reported\n               waiting. This occurred when the calling process was\n               executing on a higher priority than the process being\n               inspected. This bug has been present since OTP 21.0\n               (erts version 10.0).\n\n\n  OTP-17642    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-5248\n\n               A race between an exiting port and handling of\n               simultaneously received signals to that port could\n               cause a runtime system crash. The effected signals are\n               link, monitor and demonitor. On OTP 22 a similiar race\n               could also cause a memory leak when receiving an unlink\n               signal.\n\n\n  OTP-17651    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): GH-5235, PR-5244\n\n               The message queue of a process entered an inconsistent\n               state after a receive expression with an invalid\n               timeout value was executed. If the exception raised due\n               to the invalid timeout value was caught, the following\n               receive expression executed by the process could fail\n               to match messages already present in the message queue.\n\n               On OTP 24 this could also cause the whole runtime\n               system to crash.\n\n\n  OTP-17665    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): PR-5248\n\n               Sending a Port ! {PortOwner, close} signal from a\n               process other than the port owner could erroneously\n               trigger a badsig exit signal being sent to the port\n               owner process even though the correct PortOwner had\n               been passed in the signal.\n\n\n  OTP-17677    Application(s): erts\n\n               This fixes a bug in erts_factory_undo that caused the\n               heap to not be reset correctly. The erts_factory_undo\n               function is, for example, called when a\n               binary_to_term/1 call fails to reset the heap to its\n               state before the binary_to_term/1 call. This can cause\n               the heap to contain invalid terms which potentially can\n               cause issues (e.g., crashes) when the whole heap is\n               scanned.\n\n\n  OTP-17700    Application(s): erts\n               Related Id(s): GH-5271, PR-5273\n\n               Fix bug in persistent_term when a key-value pair\n               contains a magic reference that is referred more than\n               once. Magic references are NIF resources or returned\n               from BIFs like ets:new, atomics:new. The bug could\n               cause the memory of the referred resource to be\n               prematurely deallocated.\n\n               The bug also apply to magic references in message\n               passing on a runtime built with configure option\n               --enable-sharing-preserving.\n\n               Bug exist for 64-bit since OTP-24.0 and for 32-bit\n               since OTP-20.0.\n\n\n Full runtime dependencies of erts-10.7.2.14: kernel-6.5.1, sasl-3.3,\n stdlib-3.5\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n --- ssh-4.9.1.4 -----------------------------------------------------\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Note!
